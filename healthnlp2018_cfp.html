        <h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Call for Papers</span></h4>
        <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies have received significant attention in the medical domain and have demonstrated numerous successful uses in healthcare applications. The 2018 HealthNLP workshop will provide a unique platform for close interactions among students, scholars, and industry professionals who are interested in NLP over health data such as clinical notes, social media, and biomedical literature. This new workshop will be held in conjunction with the IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics in New York City on June 5<sup>th</sup>, 2018.</p>
        <p>HealthNLP 2018 invites papers and abstracts about original research and works in progress in natural language processing over health data, focusing on methods, tools, and applications. All submitted papers and abstracts will be peer-reviewed, and selected papers and abstracts will be featured as oral / poster presentations at the workshop. The day-long workshop will also feature a keynote speech and a roundtable discussion.</p>

        <h4><span style="color: #ff0000;">Topics of interest</span></h4>
        <p>The topics of interest for the papers and abstracts include:</p>
        <p><strong>NLP methods</strong>: Original methodological research, including but not limited to the following areas: named entity recognition, word sense disambiguation, relation extraction, syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling, topic modeling, discourse analysis, and deep learning</p>
        <p><strong>NLP software tools</strong>: Any general or specific NLP tools for health-related text data, including clinical notes, biomedical literature, and social media.</p>
        <p><strong>NLP applications</strong>: Novel applications of NLP tools and methodologies, including uses of NLP for clinical research or operation, examples including pharmacovigilance, clinical decision support, shared decision making, computable phenotyping, predictive modeling, risk prediction, and social media mining.</p>
        <h4><span style="color: #ff0000;">Submission and Review</span></h4>
        <p>Authors may submit regular papers (4-10 pages, including references) and abstracts (2 pages, including references) in the format used for the ICHI submissions. Developers of NLP tools may submit a demo paper (up to 4 pages, including references) describing the tool, along with a link to a web demonstration (interactive website or a demonstration video). As with ICHI, the workshop will follow single-blind reviewing, therefore submissions should have the names and affiliations of authors listed on the paper. Papers must adhere to the IEEE Proceedings Format available for LaTeX and Word, and submitted as a single PDF file. Submissions will be handled electronically through EasyChair<span style="color: #0000ff;"> (link here)</span>. For more information, please read the detailed submission instructions<span style="color: #0000ff;"> (link here)</span>.</p>
        <p>All submissions will undergo a peer review by at least two domain experts from the program committee. The selection of papers and posters will be primarily based on the potential to generate discussion and impact future research directions. Accepted papers will be included in the ICHI 2018 Proceedings and IEEE Digital Library. Plans are underway to also invite authors of selected papers to publish an extended version of their work in a special issue of BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making journal.</p>
